# Library

An interactive online book library where you can store the books that you like.

## Live Link

[View On GitHub page](#)

## Features

- You can add the book including title, author, number of pages of the book and read status.
- You can also remove the book by simply clicking `Remove the Book` button.
- You can also change the read status by toggling the checkbox on book card.
- Book cards are remembered in your browser after refreshing the page.

## Improvements to be made

Although I'm completely satisfied with the layout of the page, I'm also irritated by my own CSS.

Javascript code is a bit messy especially the `localStorage` part as I am not still familiar with `JSON` and `localStorage` method. Optimizations are still needed. But I probably won't be redoing this project since it is too small.
